# Idea
Question all assumptions, think outside the box, reach the ultimate solution.

## Random Thoughts
- Give something that will make people better in their social groups.

General-purpose technologies:
- electricity
- internal combustion engine
- computers
- AI
- ...

## Example Ideas
- Distributed, encrypted, self-hosting for everybody. Users decide how much space to host for others and get that much space in return.
    - Distributed data will never be entirely on one remote computer. Reason: More security.
    - Data is distributed nearby and further away. Reason: Resiliency from natural disasters affecting a large area.
    - Artificially limit bandwidth. Reason: Be kind to users' computers, and don't take up their entire internet bandwidth.
        - This product is primarily meant for data redundancy, aka backup(s).
    - Pricing tiers:
        - Basic: Exact match of shared resources (amount of memory and bandwidth)
        - Pro User: Request more redundancy (and bandwidth). Cost: $0.50 per 10 GB per month, with 70% distributed to Pro Suppliers, 10% to environment, 10% to social causes as voted by users, 10% split between core developers. No long term contracts.
            - It is recommended to have your data duplicated at least 3 times in order to ensure good recoverability.
        - Pro Supplier: Provide extra storage (and bandwidth) for others. In return, you get $0.35 per 10 GB per month. With a spare 1 TB shared, that's equivalent to $35/month, aka $420/year, which is more than enough to buy four 4TB HDD (and some socks) each year (as of 2020, caveat: full payment if all storage is used by others).
            - Dev: Edge-case to handle: Somebody with 50 TB to share, but only 20MB bandwidth is not that useful... maybe need to have some tiers depending on bandwidth.
