## Random ideas
1. Distributed, encrypted, self-hosting for everybody. People decide how much space to host for others (and get that much space in return divided by how many times they want the data copied/redundant).
    - Maybe have an option for saying local or further away, giving percentage. Meh
    - Maybe artifitially limit the bandwith so that people's hardware isn't constantly spinning fast. And, have a note about this program is mainly meant as a backup.
        - Maybe provide a charge for people that use more than a certain threshold so that people storing the data can get paid a little bit.
1. Good-looking app in terminal window by manipulating pixels?
    - Would need to get size of terminal screen space. Likely should create a framework for it that understands size changes.
    - Reason? A tiny bit of portability with Bash, but may be easier to just include Bash, or even easier to include Node/Electron/Chromium/Java/Python.
