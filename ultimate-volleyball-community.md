# Ultimate Volleyball Community


Overall goals:
- Relatively cheap
- Volleyball always available 24/7
- Includes:
  - Apartments
  - Indoor sand volleyball courts
  - Outdoor sand volleyball courts
  - Indoor hard-court volleyball courts

It won't be a money-making idea to have large apartments and many courts. Probably better to have more like a dorm-style small apartment for volleyball players in training, with maybe 2 courts at most. Maybe a better idea would be to have many different sports supported at the apartment, or just have a gym nearby.

## Ideas

- 1 warm-up place to hit ball against wall (likely by the indoor hard-court)
- 1 small shop for drinks: water, electrolyte drink, energy drink, coffee, tea, alcohol
- 1 small kitchen for breakfast/lunch/dinner/late-night
- lap pool
- hot tub
- weight room
- study area with books, chairs, tables, workplace
- dog park
- plan: plenty of hang-out areas so residents don't want to leave. Resident option for 'all-inclusive' or just pay for everything separate
