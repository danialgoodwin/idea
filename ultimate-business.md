# Ultimate Business

## Requirements
- Make employees happy first (but not at the expense of customers). Then, make customers happy (but not at the expense of the product). But, still need to be profitable. There are always trade-offs.
- Should not have to focus on shareholders, if any

## Thoughts
- Share profits with employees. Maybe 20% R&D, 20% to infrastucture/logistics, 10% to parent company/franchise, 10% to employees. These percentages could be variable, the point is non-zero percentage share to employees. Reason: Morale boost. Reason: Share the wealth.
- Share automation revenue with employees that lost their job due to automation, depreciating over time.
