# Ultimate City


## Requirements
- People-first emphasis, i.e. walkable


## Thoughts
- Main mode of transportation within the city would be walking, then biking, then public transportation

- We can get great ideas from Barcelona's Superblocks:
    - [Civic Superblocks: Barcelona’s Urban Redesign Returns Streets to Residents](https://99percentinvisible.org/article/civic-superblocks-barcelonas-urban-redesign-returns-streets-residents/)

- Can we get some ideas from Disney World? A lot of people are walking around a lot there

## Maybe
- Start with a light-railway line, with each station about 1(maybe?) mile away from each other so people only have to walk .5 mile to reach things in between. Perhaps a circular line? (of diameter of 2 miles with 4 stations?) How many people can fix in a city like this? Maybe a figure 8 instead so that wheels on the outside don't always get the extra wear-and-tear, though the 8-shape is less efficient than an long oval/stadium shape
    - Next to the train tracks can be a road for cars (on the outside) and road for bikes/scooters (on the inside). Also, have sporatic trees. The only cars allowed inside would be emergency vehicles and delivery trucks for businesses
    - Have each station have a large/tall apartment building (or, 'ultimate building' that includes a park) and large/tall parking garage. Also, have a large bike parking and scooter parking area near the light-rail station. There would be no parking spaces within the train circle
        - There should be more than 4 apartment building 1 school so that people won't segregate too much. Thought: We don't want people in school only hanging out with people from their same apartment building (imagine if there were just 2 apartments, or 3)
    - Each station could have package pick-up also (think: Amazon lockers), thus more efficient for deliveries. Or, maybe don't need that because the only residential area would be tall apartment building that can handle that too.
    - Each station should also have a strip-mall (perhaps indoor-style) built-in with plenty of jobs (retail/entertainment/food), easily walkable, and no need for employees to have another form of transportation
    - Should each of the four (or more?) stations have a theme? music/art, sport/outdoors, tech/arcade/game, theme park
    - One school area in the center?  
    - Each station should also have an office building, though it may start off relatively empty in the beginning until more companies move in (with tiny headquarters)
    - Maybe raised bike-highways?
    - Eventually, instead of having a few long trains, there should be more short/tiny rail vehicles that people can choose the destination for. Maybe elevator-like? Perhaps more like autonomous vehicles on the rail
    - Dedicated space for flea market and farm market? Can also be used as a general exchange for other things no longer needed
    - Have an indoor strip mall similar to what Japan has, i.e. have a roof, though it is all still open-air

- Maybe have ha-ha walls instead of the traditional ones: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ha-ha?utm_source=hackernewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=learn
- Leave space for easier re-modeling/re-locating of businesses?
