# Ultimate Building
Perhaps, the ultimate building would be like a self-sustaining city, with benefits of simultaneous living/working there, and should not be too expensive to live there.


Thoughts:
- The building should NOT be plain on the outside. Reason: Let people be more excited about the building, and great first-impressions
    - Maybe have a little park at the top or half-way up, including section for dogs and maybe a little bar/kitchen
- If there is an open area in the center, then that means there needs to be a max height for the surounding building. Reason: Allow for plenty of sky and sun so that it isn't too depressing there. A single side (away from sun; not ever blocking the sun) could be allowed to go much higher.
- Maybe dedicate one or two floors for shopping, with a small food court, and plenty of outdoor seating for everybody
- Maybe 3 sections on roof, split by kitchen/bar and indoor working space and entertainment area: pool, dog area, quieter area for (artifitial) lawn (astro turf) workouts and sunrise/sunset yoga. Should have lights for night too.
- Maybe building with a Denver theme/pride, including fitness, health, and pets
- Amenities:
    - Pool (maybe on the roof? meh)
- Shared rooms:
    - Maybe a conference/events room? Meh, maybe depending on climate.


Could rent be a percentage of income? And, a smaller percentage as the income gets larger? (similar to income tax rate)
