# Ultimate Operating System



## Requirements
- Multi-threaded. Reason: Allow users to do more than one thing at a time.
- Package/App manager. Reason: Allow users to easily install AND uninstall (all information related to an app). Reason: For pro users and for business that want to easily automate the system setup process.

## Thoughts


- Need a 'truth line' where apps can't display information above that line. This is to help people not get tricked too easily.
  - Example: Google Chrome's pop-ups extend above the 'truth line', which apps can't do.


- Themes (colors, wallpaper) should be easy to make and share by end-users. Nah, just start with consistency, don't want to get too fragmented in the beginning.
