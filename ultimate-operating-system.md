# Ultimate Operating System

Features:
- Multi-threaded. Reason: Allow users to do more than one thing at a time.
- Package/App manager. Reason: Single-source of truth, and allow users to easily install AND uninstall (all information related to an app). Reason: For pro users and for business that want to easily automate the system setup process.
- All apps run in a 'virtual OS', and it can easily be seen what files each app is trying to read and write. Reason: Security and privacy
- Themes (colors, wallpaper) should be easy to make and shared by users.
- File extensions aren't 100% required, but are useful. (Note: )
  - .app
  - .audio
  - .config (includes configuration for apps, playlist, themes)
  - .image
  - .text
  - .video
  - .zip
  - Maybe: '.m' for 'media'. And:
    - .ma (media-audio)
    - .mi (media-image)
    - .mg (media-gif)
    - .mv (media-video)


# Thoughts
- Need a 'truth line' where apps can't display information above/below that line. Reason: This is to help people not get tricked too easily.
  - Example: Google Chrome's pop-ups extend above the 'truth line', which apps/websites can't do.
